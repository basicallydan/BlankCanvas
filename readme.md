# HTML5 Canvas Game Boilerplate

I made this little repo as a good starting point for any from-scratch HTML5 canvas-based 2D game. Whenever I start a new game I have to do all this stuff manually if I'm not using a framework, so I thought it might be useful to put the boilerplate somewhere.

## What this boilerplate is...

* A great way to get started with canvas games
* Easy to understand
* Easy to extend

## What this boilerplate isn't...

* A fully-featured game development tool
* A tool to create modern, advanced games

## It includes:

* A simple `Game` object which contains the loop
* Methods to preload images
* Methods to preload audio
* Ability to play audio and pause audio
* Basic event listening/triggering
	* Event handling for when the game finishes loading the assets

## It *will* include:

* Basic input control handling
* Methods to stop and mix audio
