# HTML5 Canvas Game Boilerplate

I made this little repo as a good starting point for any from-scratch HTML5 canvas-based 2D game. Whenever I start a new game I have to do all this stuff manually if I'm not using a framework, so I thought it might be useful to put the boilerplate somewhere.

## It includes:

* A simple `Game` object which contains the loop
* Methods to preload images

## It *will* include:

* Methods to preload audio
* Event handlers for load finished events
* Basic input control handling
* Methods to play, stop, pause and mix audio
